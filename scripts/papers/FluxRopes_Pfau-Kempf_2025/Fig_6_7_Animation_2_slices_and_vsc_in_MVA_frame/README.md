# The Shrimp

Fig. 5 and Animation 2 dissect the flux rope known as "The Shrimp".

[[generate_shrimp.sh]] is your one-stop script to regenerate the figure and animation, including the ffmpeg compilation of the finasl `*.mp4` file.

[[plot_shrimp.py]] uses `gridspec` for the neat layout and includes the MVA analysis code courtesy of Lucile Turc. That in turn uses another customised version of [[plot_colormap3dslice.py]], provided here, which does the contours and fluxrope markers. 


# Makkara

Fig. 6 dissects the flux rope known as "Makkara".

[[generate_makkara.sh]] -- now you know how the makkara is made. Hopefully you will still want to eat it henceforth.

[[plot_makkara.py]] slices it up for you, using the same customised version of [[plot_colormap3dslice.py]], provided here.

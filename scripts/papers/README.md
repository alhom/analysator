## Neutral lines
[This script](alho2024_inspect_neutral_lines.py) is used to produce sliced plots in the local LMN coordinates, as used in Alho+2024 https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-42-145-2024 (Figures 8b, 8c, 10c, 10d).


## Cusp and magnetopause
The scripts in [[Horaites_2023]] can be used to reproduce some of the results from [Horaites et al. (2023)[https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JA031374].


## Flux ropes
The scripts in [[FluxRopes_Pfau-Kempf_2025]] can be used to post-process Vlasiator 3D run outputs including `vg_fluxrope` and produce the figures published by [Pfau-Kempf et al. (2025)](https://angeo.copernicus.org/preprints/angeo-2024-26/). Includes some customisations and xkcd features.
